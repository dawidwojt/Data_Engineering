This is a PowerShell script designed to sort files in a directory and show most important statistics about folders.
First off, files are separated into folder based on datatypes.

In the source, script looks for file in C:\temp folder, yet it can be easily modified by just changing the value of two paramters so that the script can be used in other locations.
