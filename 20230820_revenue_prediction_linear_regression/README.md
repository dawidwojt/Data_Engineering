# 20230820_revenue_prediction_linear_regression
This project is an example of how to create a simple Linear Regression model.
In this case, revenue data is sourced by a .csv file for multiple companies.
Sample data is for two companies and 23 years (but can be easily changed to other data as the .csv file can be replaced easily).
When starting the app, a user is asked to provide a year for which a revenue prediction will be calculated.
Then the main app runs and provides answers - prediction, and R2.

Plots with trend lines and values are saved to a .png file as well.

Code can be easily changed to fit other scenarios.
