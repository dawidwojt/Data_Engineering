# 20230601_genetic_algorithm_uni_project
The code has been created as a part of non-classical optimization methods course on my University. 
The code has been created with the help of resources provided as a part of the course as well as materials found online,
yet the logic has been optimized for better performance and good suit for the problem given in the project.
It is an implementation of the Travelling Salesman problem based on the Genetic Algorithm. 
The optimalization provided by the code finds the shortest travelling distance (measured by straight lines between geagraphical coordinates) 
between 10 biggest citites in Poland. All cities needs to be visited, yet there are no restrictions about which city the trip should start / end.
