# Streming Services analysis
This project is based on 4 sets of data, each one for a specific streaming service: Amazon, Disney+, Hulu and Netflix.  
In the beginning, data is downloaded by a Kaggle API.  
Then it is transformed in a careful way using pandas to tackle missing data, wrong datatypes, etc. while maintaining the data structure and avoiding the loss of data.  
The most extensive part is the data analysis part using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and wordcloud.  
Some of the results are shown below:
